For the upcoming academic year I would like to propose the following topic: **A Python-based Simulator of Channel Access in IEEE 802.11 Networks**. I put forward this topic for the consideration of 3rd year students of 

- Elektronika i Telekomunikacja,
- Electronics and Telecommunications,
- Teleinformatyka,

who plan to complete their engineer’s degrees by defending their diploma theses in January 2021.

Here's a brief description of the topic:

> The goal of the work is to implement and validate a simulator written in Python that implements the competitive channel access mechanism of IEEE 802.11 networks. The simulator should support any number of contending stations as well as configurable transmission parameters (e.g.,  the modulation and coding scheme). It should be assumed that the network is saturated (each station always has a frame to send). The simulator output should be basic statistics such as airtime, throughput, and collision probability. The operation of the simulator should be verified by comparison with results from the ns-3 simulator.

I believe the topic can be realized using [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), although I'm open to alternative approaches. 

If you are interested in writing a thesis under my supervision, please **send an e-mail to** [**szott@kt.agh.edu.pl**](mailto:szott@kt.agh.edu.pl) **by 12:00 pm (noon) on April 30th with the subject “Praca inżynierska 2021”**. Please write a few words about yourself and your motivation. Relevant information (such as past grades from related courses) is appreciated.
