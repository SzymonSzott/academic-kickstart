I'm happy to have managed to move my homepage from Wordpress before it got hacked! It's not that Wordpress doesn't issue security updates, it's that these updates kept braking the minimalist theme I was using. Also, that theme  didn't scale well to the available screen size. Looking for a static HTML solution, I came upon [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and its [Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) theme. I believe it does a good job of presenting the research I'm doing and will allow me to do the occasional blog post. Please, [let me know](/#contact) what you think of the new website! Meanwhile here's a last look at my previous, Wordpress-based homepage:
