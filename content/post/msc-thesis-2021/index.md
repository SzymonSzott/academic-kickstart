For the upcoming academic year I would like to propose the following topics for obtaining a master's degree:

1. **Performance Analysis of IEEE 802.11ax OFDMA in ns-3** -- The new multi-user channel access method provided by 11ax is being implemented in ns-3. You will get access to the development version of this code and your goal will be to assess the performance of OFDMA in comparison with single-user access.
2. **Optimizing IEEE 802.11 Networks with Deep Reinforcement Learning** -- This is a continuation of previous work ([preprint](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339660279_Contention_Window_Optimization_in_IEEE_80211ax_Networks_with_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning), [GitHub repo](https://github.com/wwydmanski/RLinWiFi)), in which DRL methods were used to dynamically set 802.11's contention window value. Your goal will be to assess the performance of this approach in a more realistic scenario.
3. **A Python-based Simulator of NR-U Channel Access** -- Write a simulator of the channel access procedure of New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) using a Python library (e.g., SimPy, NumPy). 

I put forward these topics for the consideration of students who plan to complete their master's degrees by defending their diploma theses in 2021.

If you are interested in writing a thesis under my supervision, please **send an e-mail to** [**szott@kt.agh.edu.pl**](mailto:szott@kt.agh.edu.pl) **by 12:00 pm (noon) on July 28th with the subject “Praca magisterska 2021”**. Please write a few words about yourself and your motivation. Relevant information (such as past grades from related courses) is appreciated.
