# Abstract.
abstract = "Research efforts at network design in the area of Autonomic Networking and Self-Managing Networks have reached a maturity level that forms a strong foundation toward standardization of architectural principles of the Self-Managing Future Internet. Therefore, an Industry Specification Group (ISG) on Autonomic network engineering for the self-managing Future Internet (AFI) has been established under the auspices of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). Upon its creation, the main stakeholders agreed to harmonize the previous developments and the most recent trends in the very vital field of autonomic and self-managing networks. Particularly, the life cycle of AFI is structured by Work Items providing the foundation for ETSI Group Specifications. So far AFI has been focusing on scenarios, use cases, and requirements for the autonomic/selfmanaging Future Internet, as well as on architectural reference model for autonomic networking and self-management. Most recently, AFI has continued with a new Work Item on requirements analysis and specification of implementation-oriented solutions for autonomics and self-management. At the same time, as a part of the global ecosystem, AFI is establishing strategic liaisons with the standards developing organizations and research community."
