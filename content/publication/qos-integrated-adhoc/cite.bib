abstract="Ad-hoc networking is becoming a promising solution to increase the radio coverage of wireless systems. Integrated mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), considered as multi-hop networks connected to fixed networks through one or more gateways, seem to be very profitable for both the provider and the user. This article describes an architecture for end-to-end QoS in such MANETs, developed within the IST project DAIDALOS II. In order to explain the framework's functionality, the technology, service differentiation mechanisms, MAC layer measurements, and signalling protocols are discussed. The modules required by the network elements as well as their integration are also described. Additionally, the paper presents the results obtained during verification tests performed in exemplary testbed scenarios.",
